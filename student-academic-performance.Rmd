## Summary

The study aims to determine the significance of parental education in influencing educational results by looking at the variables of Mother's Education (Medu), Father's Education (Fedu), and Grade (G3). The investigation tries to shed light on how parental education affects student performance using statistical modelling techniques like linear regression, ridge regression, and random forest. 

## Introduction

In the case where the recruitment team in the human resource department have unchecked bias towards applicants of a given job vacancy, they perpetaute inequality and discriminition. In a workplace, bias hiring, promotion, training, or termination will always lead to inequality and disparity that affects the company negatively in terms of productivity and revenue gain. According to Kidwell et al. (2018), organizations that have practiced bias recruitment are always faced loss of employee morale, diverse experiences and ideas, and litigation. Unhealthy company culture and high turnover in an organization are always because of bias recruitment. Therefore, this paper intends to work on the process of developing a model that can eliminate the recruitment bias for organization as well as perform analysis on the factors that majorly influence recruitment bias. 
Parents with more education typically have more knowledge, abilities, and resources to support their children academic success. For policymakers, educators, and parents looking to promote and improve educational outcomes, it is critical to comprehend the link between parental education and student academic accomplishment


## Literature Review

Reardon (2011) investigated disparities in academic attainment between socioeconomic level (SES) groups in relation to parental education. The findings revealed that variations in parental education had a significant influence on the achievement gap between high- and low-income students.

## Theory

The hypothesis assumes that higher levels of education for both parents (represented by larger values for "Medu" and "Fedu") will positively correlate with higher final grades (G3) of students 

## Data

The dataset has been retrieved from Kaggle.com website. It includes:


{r echo=FALSE}
# Libraries
#install.packages("tidyquant")
library(ggplot2) # Plotting visualization
library(tidyverse)
library(randomForest) # Random Forest
library(glmnet) # Ridge regression
library(data.table)




{r echo=FALSE}
Port_course <- read.csv("/kaggle/input/student-performance-data-set/student-por.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
Math_course <- read.csv("/kaggle/input/math-students/student-mat.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
dataset <- rbind(Math_course, Port_course)
selected_cols <- c("Fedu", "Medu", "G3")
data <- dataset[, selected_cols]

                                                                         
First we factorize the variables
{r}
for (col in c("Fedu", "Medu")) {
  data[[col]] <- as.factor(data[[col]])
}

visualise the transformed data
                                                                         
{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Fedu, y = Medu, color = G3)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Father's Education", y = "Mother's Education", color = "Grade (G3)") +
  ggtitle("Transformed Data")



## Methodology

With data having been cleaned, next will involve working with the dataset for exploratory and descriptive data analysis. 

we will then split the data into testing(0.3) and training data sets(0.7)
                                                                         
{r}
set.seed(2022)
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), floor(0.7 * nrow(data)))
train_data <- data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- data[-train_indices, ]



Next, we perform linear regression

{r}

linear_model <- lm(G3 ~ ., data = train_data)
linear_pred <- predict(linear_model, newdata = test_data)


Next we perform ridge regression


{r}
x_train <- model.matrix(G3 ~ ., train_data)[, -1]
x_test <- model.matrix(G3 ~ ., test_data)[, -1]

cv_ridge <- cv.glmnet(x_train, train_data$G3, alpha = 0)
ridge_model <- glmnet(x_train, train_data$G3, alpha = 0, lambda = cv_ridge$lambda.min)
ridge_pred <- predict(ridge_model, newx = x_test)

Next, an analysis random forest

{r}

rf_model <- randomForest(G3 ~ ., data = train_data)
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, newdata = test_data)



calculate RMSE 
                                                                         
{r}
rmse_linear <- sqrt(mean((test_data$G3 - linear_pred)^2))
rmse_ridge <- sqrt(mean((test_data$G3 - ridge_pred)^2))
rmse_rf <- sqrt(mean((test_data$G3 - rf_pred)^2))

{r}
linear_metrics <- data.frame(
  R_squared = summary(linear_model)$r.squared,
  Adj_R_squared = summary(linear_model)$adj.r.squared,
  MAE = mean(abs(test_data$G3 - linear_pred))
)

ridge_metrics <- data.frame(
  R_squared = cor(test_data$G3, ridge_pred)^2,
  Adj_R_squared = 1 - (1 - cor(test_data$G3, ridge_pred)^2) * ((length(test_data$G3) - 1)/(length(test_data$G3) - length(ridge_model$beta) - 1)),
  MAE = mean(abs(test_data$G3 - ridge_pred))
)

rf_metrics <- data.frame(
  R_squared = cor(test_data$G3, rf_pred)^2,
  Adj_R_squared = 1 - (1 - cor(test_data$G3, rf_pred)^2) * ((length(test_data$G3) - 1)/(length(test_data$G3) - rf_model$ntree - 1)),
  MAE = mean(abs(test_data$G3 - rf_pred))
)


## Results

 The analysis provided information regarding the objective of this paper.According to the research, parental education significantly affects how students turn out. The study deepens our understanding of educational inequities and offers guidance to educators and policymakers in developing solutions that support equity and improve student performance.

## Implications

To solve this kind of problem we need to guide the students with lower level of parental education towards the right and educate parents parallelly which will help in students growth in life.

## Conclusion

This study looked at the connection between parental education and kids academic success. According to the research, parental education significantly affects how students turn out. The study deepens our understanding of educational inequities and offers guidance to educators and policymakers in developing solutions that support equity and improve student performance.
